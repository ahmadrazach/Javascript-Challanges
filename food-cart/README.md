# Food cart application

Start the application (both backend and frontend):
- folder/food-car
```
npm run dev
```

Node Server
You need to create data for at least 10-15 fruits and store it locally on your server, you will also store the images locally on the same server and will send the link of the image along with your API response. The API response should have the following keys

- Name of fruit
- the price of fruit (You can use a dummy price)
- the image of fruit (You can select the images from this dataset https://github.com/Horea94/Fruit-Images-Dataset)

React Application
You will display the names and images within the response with checkboxes within the application along with an "Add To Cart" button. On selecting the fruits from checkboxes and pressing the Add to Cart Button, all the fruits selected should be transferred to the Cart and the screen should navigate to "Checkout Page" where all the cart items will be displayed with a total price

There will be two pages

- Main page displaying all the fruits from the Node API, displayed with checkboxes and an "Add To Cart" button
- Checkout Page, displaying all selected fruits in the cart
